# What is that project ?

This rock paper scissors repo is a project I made folowwing the Odin Project course. The aim was to make a rock paper scissors game, first in the console and then with UI.
I had the instructions but the goal was to figure out how to do it by myself.

# Details

The user chose a button, while the computer gets randomly one of the choice. Each time the user press a button, a new round starts.
The first to get 5 points wins the game.

I used Bulma has a CSS framework to speed up the process.
I added a class change in the JS file to change the color of the alert bar based on who wins the round.
